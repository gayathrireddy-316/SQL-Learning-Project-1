#About the case study
Hello, this is my first SQL Project. The data set and the quesitons are from a case study available at https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/.
The case study is about a restaurant owner, Danny, who started a japanese restaurant in the beginning of 2021 and he only sells three of his favourite japanese food-
Sushi, Ramen, and Curry.
